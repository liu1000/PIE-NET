# Comparing Two Point Cloud Sampling Methods
In the PIE-NET paper, point clouds were generated by sampling points from CAD models (triangle meshes). Various sampling methods exist and the following two are the focus of this quick study:
1. Monte Carlo (MC), a classic uniform sampling method;
2. Poisson-Disk [[2](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6143943)], which enforces a minimal distance ($2r$) between any two sampled points.

As in the paper, 8096 was set to be the desired number of points in the generated point clouds. We will see that MC was able to generate exact 8096 points, whereas Poisson-Disk could at best approximate the number. 

## Visual Comparison and Discussion
As an example, point clouds sampled from the same CAD model by the two methods are displayed below, Monte Carlo on the left and Poisson-Disk right.

*Q*: Why did Poisson-Disk based point clouds show structural details better?

*Discussion*: Point clouds sampled by the Poisson-Disk algorithm were less noisy, as shown by lower dispersions of 1-NN distances in the following section.
**In other words, the space distribution of points were more regular. This made edges and corners, the irregulars [[3](https://cecas.clemson.edu/~stb/ece847/internal/classic_vision_papers/attneave_1954.pdf)], stand out more.**
I would guess that PIE-NET perform better for point clouds sampled with Poisson-Disk.
